/**
 * <p>Minium methods that perform some kind of client asynchronous operation must have
 * this annotation. Right now, only methods that <strong>do not return</strong>
 * {@link WebElements} are allowed to be marked as asynchronous.</p>
 * <p>In pratical terms, instead of calling the method
 * {@link JavascriptExecutor#executeScript(String, Object...)} to evaluate a
 * Minium expression, the engine will call
 * {@link JavascriptExecutor#executeAsyncScript(String, Object...)}.</p>
 * <p>Because of that, the javascript function corresponding to the declared method must receive an
 * extra argument that will correspond to the <code>callback</code> function, which must
 * be used to return this function asynchronously.</p>
